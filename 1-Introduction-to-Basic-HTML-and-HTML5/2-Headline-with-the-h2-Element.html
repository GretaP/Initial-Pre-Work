<!-- I have already done some of the freeCodeCamp exercises, so comments in the first section may be brief (I am re-doing all exercises).
With this exercise, I didn't read the directions carefully enough and forgot to leave "Hello World" at the top.  Always read directions :p-->

<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
