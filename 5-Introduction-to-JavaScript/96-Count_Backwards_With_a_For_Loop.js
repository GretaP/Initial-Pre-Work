/* Learned: I have not looped backwards using a for loop before.  Learned that for loops can loop backwards, and at any interval.
Also, I finally put in semicolons rather than commas in the for loop BEFORE trying to run.

// Example
var ourArray = [];

for (var i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
for (var i=9; i>0; i -=2){
  myArray.push(i);
