/* javascript says hello!

Note to whoever looks through my application: Through the basic JS challenges, I have adopted a style of commenting to acknowledge the problem but not more if the problem was not a learning experience for me.
For any assignment which was a learning experience or reminded me of things I had already learned, the comments start with one of the following:  Learned: / Relearned:  / Recap:  / etc.
Hopefully a few of the comments will elicit a smile, and lighten someone's day :)
