// Learned: I wasn't familiar with the use of a variable to access a property of an object, although it makes sense for dymanic situations.

// Setup
var testObj = {
  12: "Namath",
  16: "Montana",
  19: "Unitas"
};

// Only change code below this line;

var playerNumber = 16;       // Change this Line
var player = testObj[playerNumber];   // Change this Line
