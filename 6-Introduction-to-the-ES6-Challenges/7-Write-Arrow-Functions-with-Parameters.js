// Recap: again, good review for me!  For my own notes, I have kept the original exercise from freeCodeCamp, which requested to re-write the given function into an arrow function.

const myConcat = (arr1,arr2) => arr1.concat(arr2);

/* original for reference:
var myConcat = function(arr1, arr2) {
  "use strict";
  return arr1.concat(arr2);
};
// test your code
console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]));
